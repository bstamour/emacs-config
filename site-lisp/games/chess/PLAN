chess-autosave
- this module currently isn't working at all!
- doesn't support undoing of moves

chess-clock
- sometimes, the clock gets shut off (while playing on ICS) for no
  reason that I can determine

chess-irc
- if I move before my opponent has connected, I get a symbol assertion
  about "value"

chess-network
- does not work at all!

chess-gnuchess
- triggers a Lisp error when I resign

chess-ics
- takebacks still aren't working 100%; when I submit a takeback
  request manually, and the other side accepts, my client doesn't know
  what to do with it
- accept of a match request doesn't seem to be working always
- resuming adjourned games does not work at all
- not detecting forfeit by disconnection at the moment

chess-display
- although chess-display-side-to-move is using faces, the Black/White
  text doesn't show the face in the modeline
- sometimes the final event of a game doesn't change the modeline,
  like CHECKMATE, or FLAG FELL
- if I win a game, it still reports CHECKMATE incorrect; if I'm white,
  it does so on the last ply (per display)
- need a "save this game to a PGN file/database" command

chess-engine
- if I say "y" to accepting something from my opponent (new game,
  takeback, etc), I get left with an hourglass cursor
- if no chess engine is available, there is no nice message being
  printed

chess-ply
- detect games drawn by three-fold repetition and the 50 move rule
  (Note, FIDE rules define that a draw must be claimed by one
   of the opponents, so we do not really need to do this on
   every move, just when a draw is requested.)

chess-pgn
- when saving a full game to the clipboard, it shouldn't need to save
  the FEN if it's starting from a standard position (this doesn't
  always happen)
- sometimes when clipping to the clipboard the final "*" is stuck to
  the text of the last move

chess-german
- complete translation

general
- add an 'install' target to the Makefile
- use more asserts throughout the code
- profile and mem profile
- elint all files
- add docstrings/texi content
- use checkdoc on all files
